# RepeatChecker
repeat word/phrase checker

Designed to identify repeat words and phrases in written documents and displays the most commonly repeated ones
and their repeat count.
Good for people who do a lot of writing, and do not wish to sound overly repetitive or make duplicate typos.
The repeat checker does not consider common pronouns as potential repeat words as they are unavoidable.
This program fails to not consider certain nouns that the writer cannot avoid (i.e. common names or places in a story) 
because the program does not have a way of determining these.
